# Ptero-Wrapper
A NodeJS Wrapper for the PterodactylPanel API

Pterowrapper makes interfacing with the pterodactyl panel easy and quick as creating a panel object. It deals with all of the security headers and requests so you dont need to write a 20 line function to run a simple query to the API. Simply put in your API key and panel URL and you are good to go!

(This is designed for a future high availability gameserver project but it can be used in any others as well)
